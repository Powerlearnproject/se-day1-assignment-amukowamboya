Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Is the process of sesigning, developing, tesing and maintaining software.

Importance: 
To develop software applications for improving quality, budget and time efficiency.
It also ensure that the software that has to be built should be consistent, correct and also on time, and within the required requirements.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
1. The Birth of Structured programming( 1960s-1970s)
    Introduced clear ways to organize code using simple structures like loops and conditionals.
    The made it easier to write, understand and fix software by reducing mess and confusng.
2. The Introduction of the Waterfall model (1970s)
   A step by step approach to software developemtn with stages like spanning, designing, building, testing and maintaining.
   These provided a clear, organized way to manage projects, although it could be inflexible and slow to adapt.
   
3. The Rise of Agile methodologies (2000s)
   Focused on flexibility, teamwork and delivering small, working pieces of sodtware frequently.
   These allowed teams to adapt quickily to changes and better meet customer needs, leading to more efficient and responsive developments.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
